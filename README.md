# Personal website blog thingy

I do not feel the need to update as often as I once did.

## TODO:

## github pages deployment

- https://nuxt.com/deploy/github-pages

```
If you are not using a custom domain, you need to set NUXT_APP_BASE_URL to your repository-slug for your build step.Example: https://<user>.github.io/<repository>/: NUXT_APP_BASE_URL=/<repository>/ npx nuxt build --preset github_pages
```
