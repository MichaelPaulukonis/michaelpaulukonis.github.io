# A Nuxt blog using Content

This static blog is based on [Nuxt Blog Starter](https://github.com/GonzaloHirsch/nuxt-blog-starter)

I've smushed in ("integrated" is perhaps too generous) a different style for the front page, and am forcing it into the blog pages, as well.

I've also had to upgrade Nuxt and some other dependencies.


```shell
> nvm use 18
> rm package-lock.json
> rm -rf node_modules
> npm i -d nuxt@latest
> npm i -D @nuxtjs/tailwindcss@latest
> npx nuxi@latest devtools enable
```

Enabling `devtools` is not required if you've already added it to your `nuxt.config.ts`.

## Styling originally based on Marina Aisa

Marina's [nuxt markdown blog starter](https://github.com/marinaaisa/nuxt-markdown-blog-starter) was the original basis for the design, but the colors were electrified and more things changed. I hope to iteratively come up with a legible compromise between several designs. I may be an artist and a programmer, but CSS is not my favorite medium.
