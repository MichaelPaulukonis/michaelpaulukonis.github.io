Hi, I'm Michael! I fell in love with programming because of the magic - seeing 'hello world' appear on a screen still amazes me after all these years. Practially speaking - I like turning vague and abstract ideas into working systems. I pick up languages quickly and love solving problems with modern tools like Node.js, TypeScript, AWS and ChatGPT.

In my most recent day-job, I spent 7 years building cloud-native products from concept to market, working with AWS infrastructure and complex microservices architecture on a small innovation team. I have a history of turning tribal knowledge into documented, shareable expertise and transforming messy legacy code (sometimes my own) into stable, tested, deployable systems.

Recently, I've been exploring ai-assisted development. It's overhyped, but there is still fire behind the smoke, and I want to see how these emerging ML tools can actually help what do.
