## We can rebuild it for you wholesale!

written by [this person](https://github.com/tsulej/GenerateMe/tree/master/watmap).

A [friend](http://help.everythingability.com/watmap/) thinks of it a "a poor-man's GAN". I don't agree with this, although I can see the similarities: an image is "recreated", using style elements from something else.

Original developer refers to it as part of a "glitch-aesthetic" which I get - but it's not a glitch, an error. There are seeming "hiccups" in the discontinutites.

[This guy](https://www.instagram.com/richard.winters/) is using a custom version inspired by WATMAP, I believe. Using square-subsections (instead of variadic-sized rectangles) and processes each color channel (RGB?) separately.
