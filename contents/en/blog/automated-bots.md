## What are you talking about?


>>bquote<<
Well I drove down to Big D.C. 
And I walked into Room 1003 
And there they were The Big Boys. 
And they were talking Big B Little O Little M Silent B 
They were saying: '''Let's teach those robots how to play hardball. 
Let's teach those little fellas a little gratitude.'''
-> Laurie Anderson, ''Sharkey's Night'', Home of the Brave, 1985

I am trying to make a variety of bots. I have made ''some'' bots.

I thought about this for over a year, until somebody goaded me into [[http://bbs.boingboing.net/t/comprehensively-addressing-the-stupid-intellectually-dishonest-critique-of-anita-sarkeesian/40229/139|actualizing a joke]].

I started out with Google-spreadhsheet-script bots, and "graduated" to [[NodeJs|node.js]] bots running on [[WebDevelopment/Heroku]].

See [[Programming.Bots]] for technical notes (in link form, mostly).

I have some ideas for future bots, but who knows. These things are fun, programming exercises, linguistic exercises, artistic expressions, artistic experiments, autistic experiments, and whoknowswhat.

This tiny url - [[http://tinyurl.com/xraybots]] - points back to this page. But is tinier.

Bots that use Tracery/[[http://cheapbotsdonequick.com/|Cheap Bot Done Quick]] may have some source and notes @ https://github.com/MichaelPaulukonis/tracery-grammars

!!! Drug Packages Bot
* https://twitter.com/DrugPackagesBot
* [[https://github.com/MichaelPaulukonis/drugpackagebot]]
-> Tweets unique FDA recognized drug packaging sourced from http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/InformationOnDrugs/ucm142438.htm. More than 17,600 distinct packaging types. At one tweet per hour, it will cycle through in about 2 years.
* NodeJs running on Heroku, using PostgreSQL as the backend to hold the index.
* This is a very simple list bot - but I did not find any extant examples in node that saved state between startups; everything I found required manually updating to the last used index.
* went live on [[https://twitter.com/DrugPackagesBot/status/598329390146158592|2015.05.12]]

!!! Numbers Bots
Messages? What messages? I meant no clandestine messages.


!!! Kim Il Sungism bot
* [[http://twitter.com/KimIlSungismBot]]
* [[https://github.com/MichaelPaulukonis/dprk.sloganeering]]
* Uses 300+ slogans released by the North Korean gubmint early in 2015, as found at [[http://boingboing.net/2015/02/13/north-korea-just-published-thi.html|BoingBoing]] (among other places; this is where I grabbed the list).
* The slogans were converted to @@pos@@ tags, and the words themselves dumped into a tag:word bank; tweets are generated by pulling a random tagged-slogan, and "re-hydrating" it with words from the bank.
* There are some capitalization issues in the word-bank; and some multi-part names should be manually combined.
* The hydration is based on Kazemi's https://www.npmjs.com/package/spew, but that has a specified vocabulary, and different manner of storing the words (by word, with potential pos tags after it, which I think is slower?). My modified version takes a "lexicon" object of tags+words as a construction parameter.
* See also my [[http://www.xradiograph.com/netart/forgreatjuche/|For Great Juche]] which went up a month earlier, doing google-searches on possibly-related keywords coupled with an unmodified slogan.
* Went live on [[https://twitter.com/KimilsungismBot/statuses/583459856713125888|2015.04.02]]

!!! Fairy Tale Titles Bot
* [[https://twitter.com/fairytaletitles]]
* [[https://github.com/MichaelPaulukonis/fttbot]]
* Basically, the [[https://github.com/MichaelPaulukonis/malepropp|MalePropp]] Fairy Tale generator running headless and discarding everything but the tale titles.
* Which aren't nearly as interesting to me devoid of their stories
* live on [[https://twitter.com/FairyTaleTitles/statuses/580197874417401856|2015.03.24]]

!!! NewMythologies
* [[https://twitter.com/NewMythologies]]
* [[https://github.com/MichaelPaulukonis/newmythologies]]
* Uses motifs from [[http://www.ualberta.ca/~urban/Projects/English/Motif_Index.htm|Motif-index of folk-literature]], as found (and modified from) a [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BooDoo/mythologybot/master/motifs.txt|file]] in BooDoo's [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BooDoo/mythologybot/|mythology bot source]].
* See also: [[https://twitter.com/mythologybot|@mythologybot]] - who had a similar idea at least 2 months before me
* So this is really derived from Stith Thompson's ''Motif-index of folk-literature: a classification of narrative elements in folktales, ballads, myths, fables, mediaeval romances, exempla, fabliaux, jest-books, and local legends.'' But, you know, "myths" and "mythologies" is... '''punchier'''.

!! Bot notes
!!! Bot 01 notes
Has a list of about 150 sub-140 char sentences from the original manifesto, a random selection sent out every 4 hours.

!!! Bot 02 notes
>>blockq<<
It uses a simple markov engine (uses my [[https://github.com/MichaelPaulukonis/NaNoGenMo.yawp/blob/master/ngram/charng.js|modification]] of Edde Addad's [[http://www.eddeaddad.net/charNG/|charng engine]] (pronounced "carnage")), sending out every 2 hours.

Also scrubs some "bad words" (using [[https://github.com/dariusk/wordfilter|Darius Kazemi's ''wordfiler'']], since "faggot" (!!) appears in the original manifesto, and was re-appearing in tweets.

It does some super-dumb text manipulations -- adds final punctuation, and capitalizes the first letter. There's some issue with google-apps-script + twitter-OAuth that doesn't seem to allow exclamation marks to go through, so final puncts are periods and question-marks.
>><<

!!! Bot 03 notes
Uses the Wordnik API, via twitter-bot-kit from darius k
running on heroku, with API keys in environment variables (which now makes local testing... NOT WORK??)
has a strange fascination with Cherokees, States General, and delendas.
WTF???!?!?
Is it NOT getting new lists?

Each and eery time, the following four values are retrieved for @@nounplural@@:

(:source lang=javascript:)[@
nounplural:
[ { id: 600459, word: 'Cherokees' },
  { id: 480440, word: 'Fishes' },
  { id: 626372, word: 'Smalls' },
  { id: 559410, word: 'States-General' } ],
@]

Hrm. Seems that if I lower the @@minCorpusCount@@ I get more results.
However, these are NOT the same things and random nouns, but pluralized.
I'm going to need a better strategy if I want to stop picking on the Cherokees and States-General.


'''DONE:''' I pulled plain old nouns, and used [[https://www.npmjs.org/package/nlp_compromise|nlp_compromise]] to pluralize 'em:

(:source lang=javascript:)[@var plural = function(noun) { return nlp.noun(noun).pluralize(); };@]

!! Announcement on bbs.boingboing.net
>>blockq<<
I've got version 0.1 up at [[https://twitter.com/SolanisBot01]]

As you can see from the name, I got the spelling dead wrong initally. It's been updated in the settings, but the orignal URL is fixed forever. Men, right?!!!

It's using [[http://zachwhalen.net/blog/13/nov/using-google-spreadsheets-generated-text-twitter-bot|this google spreadsheet process]] to send out a handful (20-ish) of cropped selections from [[http://www.womynkind.org/scum.htm|The SCUM Manifesto]].

I ran into some authentication issues and.... I'm still not sure how I resolved them. Initially, on Wednesday, I couldn't get the app set to do read+write, said I needed a mobile phone, and twitter would crash when I tried to add one (I think because my mobile number is already connected an account. My _real_ one).

Anyway. Tonight it worked, without prompting for mobile.

GO FIGURE.

At any rate, I hope to do some variations. This was a proof-of-concept. And harder than I thought, due to the auth-thing.

!! [[#plans]] Variation Plans
# Instead of working with the ORIGINAL manifesto, do a word-type replacement, and tweet that?
# tweet exactly 140-char fragments
# tweet markov'd selections
# finds related tweets and re-tweets?

!!! Solanas03 over time
randomly select minifesto until all are used up; refill.
pull a bunch of random words with a given corpus minCount; when one category is depleted, pick a new minCount and re-pull.
This will lead to a number of tweets with obscure words that then change.
Maybe.... have a heading direction for the minCount? go from common to uncommon? jump around?
don't overthink and overcomplexicize this.

He is incessantly screaming at us to eat concoctions such as beer-battered meatball sandwiches, wrapped in a pizza and deep-fried in lard. What’s for dessert? A sheet cake dipped in pancake batter, dunked in butter frosting and sprinkled with Pop-Tarts.

!!! BB-forum (discourse) statistics
track the numbers (a ''boring'' bot, but who says a bot has to be sexy!)
[[http://bbs.boingboing.net/users/othermichael/activity]]
use a back-end db, and see how things have changed since the last time?
Or just rely on in-memory state
[tweet when restarting?]

Could be an interesting "service" to others....

Shouldn't tweet everytime as post is made though... should it?
Maybe that's a "control-panel" setting....


!!! 5-word scary stories
[[https://twitter.com/hashtag/ScaryStoriesIn5Words?src=tren]]
retweet 5-word posts (that didn't originally have the hashtag) with the hashtag [@#ScaryStoriesIn5Words@]

alternatively, [@#5wordscarystory@] or [@#5wordscarystories@]

The first is just SO LONG

OTOH, the tweets themselves are small. But the use of ''in'' inside of the hashtag is ''grating''.
