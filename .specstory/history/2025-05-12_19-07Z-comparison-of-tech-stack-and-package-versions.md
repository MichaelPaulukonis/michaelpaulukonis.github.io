# Comparison of tech stack and package versions (2025-05-12 19:07Z)

_**User (2025-05-12 19:10Z)**_

Please compate the tech-stack in master.md to requirements in package.json and let me know of any essential differences. By "essential" I mean specified packages having different major versions, different frameworks, etc.

# Technology Stack Comparison

After comparing the technology stack in `master.md` with the packages in package.json, I found several essential differences:

## Major Differences

1. **Content Management**
   - `master.md` states: "Nuxt Content v3"
   - `package.json` shows: "@nuxt/content": "^2.13.4" (version 2, not 3)

2. **CSS Framework**
   - `master.md` only mentions: "CSS/SCSS for custom styling"
   - `package.json` includes: "@nuxtjs/tailwindcss": "^6.13.2" (TailwindCSS is a major component not mentioned in docs)

3. **Template Engine**
   - master.md: Not mentioned
   - `package.json` includes: "pug": "^3.0.3" and "@vue/language-plugin-pug": "^2.2.4"

## Additional Technologies in `package.json`

These aren't contradictions but important components not documented in master.md:

- "@vueuse/core": "^9.13.0" - Vue composition utilities
- "@nuxt/fonts": "^0.11.0" - Font optimization for Nuxt
- "nuxt-content-assets": "^1.4.4" - Assets handling for Nuxt Content

The Nuxt framework itself is consistent (Nuxt 3) between both documents, and GitHub Pages deployment is correctly identified in both.
