But taking two images, converting them to white or black plus a single color and compositing them together on-the-fly (repeat ad naseum)? Javascript with p5.js*is not quite fast enough for real-time (though WebGL might be able to handle it), so I broke out the threshold-conversion routine to a separate app (Monochromifier, below).

There I crop, erase, and isolate the parts I want, converting them into black-on-transparent squares. After building up a collection of these processed images, I use Renamer Browser to organize and tag them by theme or other characteristics. Then I point Duo-Chrome at a collection, and it generates a sequence by randomly selecting images and colors from a palette. The app repeats each image across two frames, so any three consecutive frames are visually connected. I then select individual images, or stitch sequences into a movie (using ffmpeg or the like). I can also navigate to recently made images and modify them - changing the color of either image, swapping colors, changing sizes, changing one or both images, etc. The results end up on Instagram, Facebook and Flickr.
