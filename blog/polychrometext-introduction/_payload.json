Warhol's screen-prints led me to think how \"text\" is almost infinitely repeatable, and thus not a comodity, like a painting or a print could be. That led me down many roads with physical concrete poetry, typewriters and text paintings. Rothko is perhaps a more oblique influence, but he was me entree to color-field painting, and how several of my college classmates couldn't stand abstract paintings like that - their irritated descriptions filled me with a desire to create something similarly monolithic. I don't think I ever really did anything over-all until recently).",[17,49,50],{},"In early 2014 I took a \"MOOC\" on Processing, and one of my exercises became Polychrometext, so-named since it's second-week of life (it had a brief life as \"Text-Painter\" which is accurate if prosaic).
