As a professional programmer who also creates art, I wanted to more deeply integrate these two passions.",[17,36,37],{},"The concept was straightforward, though the execution was anything but: for one month, from January 3rd (when I realized I wasn't going to do Genuary) to February 3rd, 2025, I would create a new, code-generated variation of the Mona Lisa every single day.  This wasn't about manipulating images in existing software; it was about writing code to generate something new each day. I'll be honest - my threshold for \"new\" was quite low - basically, anything other than the original Mona Lisa. But this wasn't about creating a masterpiece every day; it was about getting past an artistic and professional block.",[39,40,42],"h2",{"id":41},"why-the-mona-lisa","Why the Mona Lisa?",[17,44,45],{},"The Mona Lisa's ubiquity is precisely what makes it such a compelling subject.  It's an image so deeply embedded in our collective consciousness that it transcends being just a painting.  It's a cultural touchstone, a visual shorthand that everyone recognizes.  I wanted to use that familiarity as a foundation for exploration, a recognizable scaffold on which to build something new. And as a daily exercise, I can't fall back on \"I don't know what to create today.\"",[17,47,48],{},"I've also long been inspired by artists like Andy Warhol, who explored the power of repetition and variation.  I wanted to see if I could achieve a similar effect, but using code as my primary tool.  The challenge, of course, is that coded images tend toward precision and uniformity.  How could I introduce a sense of organic variation into a process that's inherently digital? I don't think I achieved any of that goal, but it was in the back of my mind throughout.",[39,50,52],{"id":51},"code-as-a-creative-tool","Code as a Creative Tool",[17,54,55,60],{},[28,56,59],{"href":57,"rel":58},"https://p5js.org",[32],"P5.js"," (a JavaScript library for creative coding) is my primary visual code framework, and my first project was very simple - a single color-channel offset. The next day, I iterated by animating the offset. And then I kept going trying other things. One day I was starting close to midnight, so I placed a single asterisk over Mona Lisa's face. The next day, I iterated by making the asterisk draggable and other features. So even really simple last-minute code paid-off by suggesting more-complicated code down the road.",[17,62,63],{},"I also finally took the plunge into the world of shaders (GPU-based rendering, often used for games, that is blazingly fast).  I had never worked with shaders before, but I had a few tutorials bookmarked, and a project I admired used them.  I began by adapting existing code to remap the Mona Lisa's colors to a limited palette.  From there, I started adding user interface (UI) controls to allow for real-time adjustments and variations.",[17,65,66],{},"As the month progressed, I explored other techniques, including color halftones and animation through gradual parameter changes.

Every day, I had to generate new code and a new visual output.  Some days, I was building on previous code, adding new parameters or UI controls.  Other days, I was starting from scratch.  And, as with any experimental process, not everything was a success.  Some of the visual effects were more compelling than others.  But even the \"failures\" were valuable, as they often pushed me in new and unexpected directions.",[17,75,76],{},"Ultimately, this project was not about creating aesthetically pleasing images. Many of them were not -- they were images, but not aesthetically pleasing.  It was about learning new techniques, pushing my own creative boundaries, and further exploring code as a creative tool.

I've mostly used dedicated UI libraries in the past, but I found that dead-simple interfaces looked decent and were easy to implement. For example, I created a simple slider to adjust parameters like color or offset, which allowed for real-time experimentation with the visual output.",[17,91,92],{},"The process of explaining coding concepts to an AI often required a precision that forced me to clarify and refine my own thinking.",[17,94,95],{},"And while the AI tools were not perfect —- they sometimes got stuck in loops or suggested non-working solutions -— they often led me down unexpected paths and sparked new ideas.  It was a learning experience, both in terms of coding and in terms of working with AI.
