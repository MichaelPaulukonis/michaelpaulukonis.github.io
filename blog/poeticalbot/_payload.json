The bot mines existing texts for words, sentences, parts of speech, and punctuation, then applies various generators and transformers to create... something poetic-adjacent.",[17,43,44],{},[45,46],"img",{"alt":47,"src":48},"a \"poem\" by poeticalbot","/media/poeticalbot_sample_email.png",[17,50,51],{},"After it was running and posting, I deployed it to Heroku's free tier (where I already had a bunch of Twitter bots running).

The original code already worked with CLI and Heroku, so adapting it to Lambda required minimal changes. The biggest challenge was refactoring my \"common-corpus\" dependency. It had been optimized for Heroku - unzipping compressed text files into the dyno's filesytem. That wouldn't work in Lambda's ephemeral environment, so we stripped out the compression code and moved the entire corpus into a Lambda layer instead. PoeticalBot got a quick tweak to use that layer when live on Lambda, but keep using the dependency locally.
